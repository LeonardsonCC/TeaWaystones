TeaWaystones is my attempt at recreating the [Waystones mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/waystones) as a spigot/paper plugin.

You can find the builds to download [here](https://releases.tardis.systems/TeaWaystones). Just drop it into your plugins folder and you should be ready to go.

The plugin is compiled for and tested with Paper 1.19.4.

## Usage

You can craft Waystones with the following crafting recipe:
[![First row: Obsidian, Eye of Ender, Obsidian; Second row: Eye of Ender, Light Blue Candle, Eye of Ender; Third row: Obsidian, Compass, Obsidian](https://share.k00.eu/image_waystones_crafting.png)

To rename a Waystone, you need to be standing directly next to one and then use the command `/tw setname <your-name>`. The name may not contain spaces.
